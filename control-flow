Handling multiple conditions with else if 

fn main() {
    let number = 6;

    if number % 4 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 4");
    } else if number % 3 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 3");
    } else if number % 2 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 2");
    } else {
        println!("number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2");
    }
}

>> Using if in a let statement 

fn main() {
    let condition = true;
    let number = if condition { 5 } else { 6 };

    println!("The value of number is: {number}");
}
Repetion usuing control flow.......
fn main() {
   let mut num = 0;

   loop {
    println!("value of number is {num}");

    if num == 10{
        break;
    }
    num = num + 1;
   } 
   println!("this is an end")
}
